# Graphing-IRT
Statistical applications make the calculations of IRT models easier and more accurate than hand calculation. However, not all applications provide the users with some outputs they need. PROC IRT in SAS does not have an option to obtain a graph on test information, standard error of estimate (SES) and log likelihood function (LLF) for a score pattern. The purpose of this paper is to apply dichotomous score IRT theories of one-parameter (1PL), two-parameter (2PL), three-parameter (3PL), and four-parameter (4PL) models and build a macro producing outputs necessary for building a graph for test information and SEE and LLF by score pattern in SAS. The calculation method used is Maximum Likelihood (ML). The users can exploit the given outputs for other uses
